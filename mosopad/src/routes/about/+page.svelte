	<h1>About this app</h1>

	<p>
		Mosopad is a small project developed by <a href="https://github.com/MihneaMoso">Mihnea Moso</a>
		 that aims to be a modern and blazing-fast alternative to <a href="https://dontpad.com">Dontpad</a>
	</p>


	<p>
		The goal of this project is to create a functional CRUD app that works just like <b>dontpad</b> but utilises
		modern browser features and SSR, powered by SvelteKit. By building this project I also hope to learn a lot
		of what I need to know about <a href="https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/">this framework</a> and ideally
		replace React and NextJS in my stack with it.
	</p>

	<!-- <p>
		The <a href="/sverdle">Sverdle</a> page illustrates SvelteKit's data loading and form handling. Try
		using it with JavaScript disabled!
